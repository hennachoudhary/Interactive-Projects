<p><br>In New York City, the total number of intimate partner homicides increased by twelve from 2015 to 2016, with the greatest number of victims falling within the age range of 25-29.  <br>

<br>However, domestic violence awareness organizations cropping up throughout the city are working to combat the prevalence of domestic violence crimes.  Jahajee Sisters, a movement-building organization that is committed to creating a safe and equitable society for females, are one of many such empowerment organizations.  

<br>Jahajee Sisters was founded in 2007 by four Indo-Caribbean women who were eager to create a haven for open dialogue among women in their community.  The organization has grown over the years through grassroots outreach, and has expanded to facilitate arts and empowerment programs, talk therapy, healing circles, and leadership development summits.  <br>

<br>The first reported New York City murder of 2018 occurred in a Richmond Hill residence where a 26-year-old mother of two, Stacy Singh, was found unconscious after suffering multiple stab wounds.  Her 46-year old husband, Vishwanand Loknath, was found three hours earlier hanging from a tree in nearby Forest Park after murdering his wife and then taking his own life, NYPD officers said.  <br>

<br>Singh had suffered abuse at the hands of her partner for years, with police intervening in September 2017, when Loknath was reported for repeatedly pummeling his wife in the back of her head with a closed fist.  A judge granted an order of protection barring him from seeing his wife until October 2019, but the couple did not heed the order, family members said.  <br>

<BR>“Stacy Singh's murder has served as a catalyst for greater awareness of this issue in our community.  It created a groundswell for more women to speak out about their own experiences with gender-based violence and seek us out for support,” said Simone Jhingoor, co-director of Jahajee Sisters.  “Many of us at Jahajee Sisters are also survivors, so when we speak we often share our own personal stories.  By sharing our stories, we are breaking the silence and shame about the issue, and hopefully inspiring others to do the same.”<BR>

<br>In the year following Singh’s murder, Jahajee Sisters increased their community engagement efforts by speaking out at faith-based institutions, connected more survivors to resources, and hired their first two staff members who are dedicated to advancing the organization’s mission to achieve gender justice. <br>

<br>At a vigil and “speak out” service hosted by Jahajee Sisters two weeks after Singh’s death, hundreds of community members, leaders, elected officials, and media gathered to support Stacy's family and discuss the tragic, brutal violence that resulted in her losing her life. <br>

<br>Jahajee Sisters is continuing to commit their mission to eradicate domestic violence through grassroots means, including self-awareness, sisterhood, and community organizing, which they hope will affect change in policy initiatives. <br>

<br> “I personally spoke out more after this happened; about my own experiences.  I grew up watching my mom deal with domestic violence, I spoke at the Stacy Singh vigil, and urged our community to speak out against these horrible acts,” said Sonilal.  “Women of all ages came out to speak their story that day, it ignited a flame of trust and hope for a better future for our community.”<br><br>

<h2>Shooting Incidents in Southern Queens </h2><br>

<p>Southern Queens’ community district nine, which consists of Richmond Hill, Woodhaven, and Kew Gardens, has seven recorded shooting incidents thus far during the course of this year, according to the NYPD’s Office of Management Analysis and Planning. <br>

<br>The NYPD released an official statement on July 10, which conveyed that Queens has seen an 11 percent increase in murder rates in 2018.  Many of the Queens murders have taken place in Southern Queens, within the 106th precinct located in Ozone Park which ranks second in highest murder percentage increases in the borough.<br>

<br>On September 14, Jonathan Narain, a 27-year-old off-duty Rikers Island correction officer, was shot and killed following a heated verbal dispute with a motorcyclist at 1:36 a.m. in South Richmond Hill, Queens.  Narain was on his way to work when he stopped for food and conversed with the motorcyclist.  While waiting in his vehicle at a traffic light, the motorcyclist pulled up to Narain’s red Honda Accord and shot him once in the head, police said.  He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.<br>
<br>Gifford Hunter, 30, was taken into custody and now faces charges of second-degree murder, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and criminal use of a firearm in the second degree. <br>

<bR>“This was a cold-hearted and senseless act of violence that will not be tolerated in Queens County, said District Attorney Richard A. Brown.  “My office will continue to work tirelessly to combat the proliferation of illegal guns in our community and will vigorously prosecute those who disobey our laws.” </bR>
