<br>In New York City, the total number of intimate partner homicides increased by twelve from 2015 to 2016, with the greatest number of victims falling within the age range of 25-29.  <br>
<br>However, domestic violence awareness organizations cropping up throughout the city are working to combat the prevalence of domestic violence crimes through peer support groups, community events, and even the arts.  Jahajee Sisters, a movement-building organization led by Indo-Caribbean women who are committed to creating a safe and equitable society for females, are one of many such empowerment organizations. This Queens-based organization fosters solidarity and empowerment through dialogue, healing sessions, the arts, leadership development, and grassroots outreach to women who have dealt with or are currently involved in abusive relationships. </br>
<br>Following the murder of Stacy Singh, a 26-year old mother from Richmond Hill, Queens, who suffered years of abuse from her husband, Jahajee Sisters has doubled their community outreach efforts by speaking out at faith institution including mosques, temples, and churches and organizing performing arts events.<br>
<bR>“Stacy Singh's murder has served as a catalyst for greater awareness of this issue in our community. It created a groundswell for more women to speak out about their own experiences with gender-based violence and seek us out for support,” said Simone Devi Jhingoor, the organization’s co-director.  “It caused elected officials to pay closer attention to the needs of our community. Most importantly, Stacy's murder has created an opening for more of our people to dialogue about the issue of gender-based violence and take action.”</bR></p>

<h2>Shooting Incidents in Southern Queens </h2><br>

<p>Southern Queens’ community district nine, which consists of Richmond Hill, Woodhaven, and Kew Gardens, has seven recorded shooting incidents during the course of this year, according to the NYPD’s Office of Management Analysis and Planning. <br>
<br>These shootings are only seven of many recorded crimes in this district within the past year.  The NYPD released an official statement on July 10, which conveyed that Queens has seen an 11 percent increase in murder rates in 2018.  Meanwhile, the citywide increase is only one incident greater than recorded in 2017.  Many of the Queens murders have taken place in Southern Queens, within the 106th precinct located in Ozone Park which ranks second in highest murder percentage increases in the borough.

</br>
<br>On September 14, Jonathan Narain, a 27-year-old off-duty Rikers Island correction officer, was shot and killed following a heated verbal dispute with a motorcyclist at 1:36 a.m. in South Richmond Hill, Queens.  Gifford Hunter, 30, was taken into custody and now faces charges of second-degree murder, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and criminal use of a firearm in the second degree. <br>
<bR>“This was a cold-hearted and senseless act of violence that will not be tolerated in Queens County, said District Attorney Richard A. Brown.  “My office will continue to work tirelessly to combat the proliferation of illegal guns in our community and will vigorously prosecute those who disobey our laws.” 

</bR>
<br>
Police reported that Narain was shot in the head at a red light and was found sitting in a red Honda Accord near 103rd Avenue and 120th Street, which is when he was quickly transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.  
</br>
<br>
“He was well respected by his co-workers and by the officers that he worked with and it’s sad, it’s sad.” said Elias Husamudeen, the president of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association.  “We deal with violence inside of here and we have to lose our lives with the violence outside of here.”
